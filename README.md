# MyString
Ushtrimi me String

README
This is a simple Java exercise, where you have to implement a class called MyString, which will act more or less like java.lang.String, but without using it as a private field. You will find descriptive JavaDoc comments at MyString.class about the problem.

Compilation and running the code

If you are willing to use an IDE you may skip this, since the IDE itself is doing the compilation and the running of the code. Otherwise, if you are going to use command-line compiler (javac or gcj), you will have to do as written below:00

Firstly, you have to change directory (using Terminal, CMD, or any other CLI) to the src directory, and then execute the below code (make sure you installed JDK and not simply JRE, and that javac and java are added to path): to compile

javac -cp cc cc/thingslab/exercise/java/MyString.java cc/thingslab/exercise/java/Main.java
This will compile the code for you. Then, you can run it (from the src directory) by executing:

java cc/thingslab/exercise/java/Main
